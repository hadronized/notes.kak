This is a small plugin to enable note and task taking. Many commands are exposed by default, but it is recommended to
add a mapping on the main user modes instead for a quicker onboarding.

# Commands and user modes

Commands are listed below, along with the user-mode and keybinding they are available from.

# Highlighters

The plugin inserts two highlighters in the `shared` scope:

- `kak-notes-tasks`, used to highlight tasks like `- TODO stuff` or `- WIP blabla`, as well subtask lists like
  `- [ ] Do this` or `- [x] Done`.
- `kak-notes-tasks-list`, used for the list view (similar to the `*grep*` buffer).
